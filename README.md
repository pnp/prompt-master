Prompt Master is a Microsoft 365 Copilot gamification solution in the form of a Power App. It is designed to be used at events such as Copilot Excitement days, Promptathons etc. 

It allows people to compete against each other for the top spot in the leaderboard by completing 'challenges' based around prompt creation.

Prompt Master uses Azure OpenAI together with a Custom Connector to rate and provide suggestions/feedback on prompts.
